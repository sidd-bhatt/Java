BUILDER

=> This design pattern lets us construct complex object step by step.
=> Lets say an object has many properties. Example: House is object and it has - floor, door, window, wall, roof,
    balcony, chimney, bathroom, restroom, drawing room, etc. Now someone might be interested in having all, someone
    might be interested having floor, door, window, wall, roof only.
=> Core idea is -
    * A class acting as POJO class defins all the properties of the object.
    * A Builder interface defined method to build(set) the properties of the object.
    * The return type of those method is of Builder type (Fluent Chaining/ Fluent Interface).
    * The Builder interface define build() method also which returns the whole built object.
    * There are Concrete Builder classes that customize all or some properties of the object.
    * Client can instantiate those custom concreete builder classes and step by step set the property of the object.
    * In the end call build().
