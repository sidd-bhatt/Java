PROTOTYPE

=> This creational design pattern allows us to copy existing object or make a copy of existing object without being
    dependent upon the classes of the object.
=> Prototype approach allows efficient duplication without repeating costly initialization.
=> Lets say I want to make a copy of existing object. I will create a new object of same class. I will have to go
    through all the field of the original object and copy their values in new object (dependency).
=> But what if some of the fields of the object are private and not visible from out side the object class. This
    problem is solved by Prototype.
=> To implement this design pattern we use Cloneable interface. Cloneable is marker interface. It marks a class -
    'safe to clone'.
=> Code includes:
    * Prototype interface:
        * defines the method for cloning objects
        * sets a standard that all concrete prototypes must follow
        * includes a clone method that concrete prototypes will implement to create copies of
        themselves.
    * Concrete Prototype:
        * implements the prototype interface
        * represents a specific type of object that can be cloned
    * Client: code or module that requests new object creation by interacting with the prototype
